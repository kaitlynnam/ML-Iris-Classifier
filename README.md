# ML-Iris-Classifier
Classify Iris flowers and explore model accuracy using k-Nearest Neighbors â€” written in Python.

##Features
Trains a KNN model on the classsic Iris dataset and visulize the data based on different perameters 
Allows users to:
  Test and tune the model's accuracy by adjusting k
  Predict flower species using custom sepal/petal measurements
Built with:
  scikit-learn
  numpy
  matplotlib
